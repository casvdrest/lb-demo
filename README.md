# Verifying Type Soundness in Agda 

This repo contains the files for a lecture on verifying type soundness in Agda, given as part of the course "Language Based Software Security" at TU Delft. 

See the Agda docs (https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.1/) for how to install and setup Agda. Alternatively you can use Agdapad (https://agdapad.quasicoherent.io/). 

To participate in the demo: copy the contents from `Assign.agda` (https://github.com/casvdrest/lb-demo/blob/main/Assign.agda) into your favourite editor, or Agdapad, and start hacking!
